# Misite Bao

Hello everyone, my name is Misite Bao, a software developer and open source contributor, as well as a self-media blogger.

At present, I mainly use technologies such as Go, Nodejs, JavaScript, etc. I am active in the open source community most of the time.

I'm currently developing [Tigago](https://github.com/tigateam/tigago) 和 [Yakia](https://github.com/misitebao/yakia), and other applications, and am an active member of the [Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) community. If you are interested, you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/misitebao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/misitebao) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGlgW9t0HnKDlkcS1dH7X3g).

If you speak [Chinese](https://misitebao.com/zh-hans), you can also find me on [Weibo](https://weibo.com/misitebao) and [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/97480642/).

Besides programming, I also like sci-fi movies and video games. The games I often play are League of Legends, PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS, and Game For Peace.
